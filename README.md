# C7Decrypt

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/claudijd/c7decrypt.png)](http://travis-ci.org/claudijd/c7decrypt)

C7Decrypt allows you to decrypt passwords which are encrypted using Cisco's Type-7 encoding scheme (aka: a Vigenere Cipher).  These "hashes" are used for user password storage, enable password storage and VTY line storage and can easily be decoded using C7Decrypt.

Still interested in what this code is all about?
